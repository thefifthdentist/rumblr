Ruby Tumblr

This project is completed as of nine weeks at NYCDA and is a culmination of students' UI/UX knowledge to date. Its purpose is to replicate a "tumblr" or personal blog app, regarding the subject of student' choice. I chose horror, so the following pages replicate the landing page of a logged in user's account, the landing page of a non-logged in user, a sign-in and sign-up page, as well as an authenticated login and related database to store the user data (name, email, birthday, password, etc.)
